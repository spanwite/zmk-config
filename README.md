## Local development workspace (Thanks [urob](https://github.com/urob))

I streamline my local build process using `nix`, `direnv` and `just`. This
automatically sets up a virtual development environment with `west`, the
`zephyr-sdk` and all its dependencies when `cd`-ing into the ZMK-workspace. The
environment is _completely isolated_ and won't pollute your system.

### Setup

#### Pre-requisites

1. Install the `nix` package manager:

    ```bash
    # Install Nix with flake support enabled
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix |
       sh -s -- install --no-confirm

    # Start the nix daemon without restarting the shell
    . /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh
    ```

2. Install [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) (and optionally but recommended
   [`nix-direnv`](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv)[^4]) using your
   package manager of choice. E.g., using the `nix` package manager that we just
   installed[^5]:

    ```
    nix profile install nixpkgs#direnv nixpkgs#nix-direnv
    ```

3. Set up the `direnv` [shell-hook](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) for your
   shell. E.g., for `bash`:

    ```bash
    # Install the shell-hook
    echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc

    # Enable nix-direnv (if installed in the previous step)
    mkdir -p ~/.config/direnv
    echo 'source $HOME/.nix-profile/share/nix-direnv/direnvrc' >> ~/.config/direnv/direnvrc

    # Optional: make direnv less verbose
    echo '[global]\nwarn_timeout = "2m"\nhide_env_diff = true' >> ~/.config/direnv/direnv.toml

    # Source the bashrc to activate the hook (or start a new shell)
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

#### Set up the workspace

1. Clone _your fork_ of this repository. I like to name my local clone
   `zmk-workspace` as it will be the toplevel of the development environment.

    ```bash
    # Replace `urob` with your username
    git clone https://github.com/urob/zmk-config zmk-workspace
    ```

2. Enter the workspace and set up the environment.

    ```bash
    # The first time you enter the workspace, you will be prompted to allow direnv
    cd zmk-workspace

    # Allow direnv for the workspace, which will set up the environment
    direnv allow

    # Initialize the Zephyr workspace and pull in the ZMK dependencies
    # (same as `west init -l config && west update && west zephyr-export`)
    just init
    ```

### Usage

After following the steps above your workspace should look like this:

```bash
zmk-workspace
├── config
├── firmware (created after building)
├── modules
│   ├── auto-layer
│   ├── helpers
│   └── tri-state
└── zmk
    └── ...
```

#### Building the firmware

To build the firmware, simply type `just build all` from anywhere within the
workspace. This will parse `build.yaml` and build the firmware for all board and
shield combinations listed there.

To only build the firmware for a specific target, use `just build <target>`.
This will build the firmware for all matching board and shield combinations. For
instance, to build the firmware for my Corneish Zen, I can type
`just build zen`, which builds both `corneish_zen_v2_left` and
`corneish_zen_v2_right`. (`just list` shows all valid build targets.)

Additional arguments to `just build` are passed on to `west`. For instance, a
pristine build can be triggered with `just build all -p`.

(For this particular example, there is also a `just clean` recipe, which clears
the build cache. To list all available recipes, type `just`. Bonus tip: `just`
provides
[completion scripts](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#shell-completion-scripts)
for many shells.)
